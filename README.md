# Discourse Theme for Containous Community

This repository contains the elements for the Discourse Forum at <https://community.containo.us/>.

The following elements are configured here:

- Stylesheets (commons and desktop/mobile specifics)
- Banners images (vectorized or rasterized)
- Theme definition

Be careful: the "components" as "Versatile Footer" are not specified in this repository
and must be configured manually on the Discourse Administration.
If not, then you'll see some errors on the CSS styelsheet, because it embeds components-level variables.
